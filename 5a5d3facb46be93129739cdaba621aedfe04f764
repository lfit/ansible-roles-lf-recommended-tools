If I add a final carriage return, I get one error, when I remove it another. Either way some of the verification/lint tooling complains? I\u0027d like to turn around any fixes required to this code fairly promptly, as I\u0027ve been sat on a ticket for a while and need to try and get this to the point it can be merged.",
